/*
 * Java inner class or nested class is a class that is declared inside the class or interface.
 * 
 * We use inner classes to logically group classes and interfaces in one place to be more readable and maintainable.
 * 
 * Additionally, it can access all the members of the outer class, including private data members and methods.
 *
 * There are three advantages of inner classes in Java. They are as follows:

Nested classes represent a particular type of relationship 
that is it can access all the members (data members and methods) of the outer class, including private.

Nested classes are used to develop more readable and maintainable code because it logically group classes and interfaces in one place only.

Code Optimization: It requires less code to write.

* There are two types of nested classes non-static and static nested classes. The non-static nested classes are also known as inner classes.

Non-static nested class (inner class)
Member inner class
Anonymous inner class
Local inner class
Static nested class
